# F# Turtle Tutorial

101 Workshop for F#, building a Logo Turtle.  Influenced by this blog post: http://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/13-ways-of-looking-at-a-turtle/

Based on "Logo", the original 1967 turtle program.  Here's an online version for reference: http://turtleacademy.com/playground/en

## Setup

Needs the .NET Core 2.1 SDK installed locally.

If you don't already have this installed click "Download .NET Core SDK" here: https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core

You'll also need Visual Studio Code, Ionide and the Visual F# Tools.

[Go here](http://fsharp.org/use/windows/) and follow "Options 2: Install Visual Studio Code", then "Option 4: Install the Visual Studio 2017 Build Tools".

## Starting the Workshop

Firstly run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build` in the root folder

Then open the root folder in Visual Studio Code (e.g: `C:\Git\FSharpTurtleTutorial`).  If you installed Ionide from the Setup section you will have syntax highlighting of the ".fs" files, you will also be able to execute lines of the file using F# Interactive directly from VS Code (Select the lines and press Alt+Enter)
